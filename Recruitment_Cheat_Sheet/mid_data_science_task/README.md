Thank you for applying for a Data Scientist position! We would like to check your
current level of experience, so can you please do our code challenge?
You can use any Python libraries the way you would do it for real tasks. Please, make sure your
code can be understood and maintained by others.

Your work will be evaluated by the following factors:
● Quality of analysis and code,
● Clarity of inference process,
● Depth of analysis,
● Reasoning.

Please do both of the tasks specified below!
Task 1: Exploratory Analysis for Music in a Car
Data set: ​https://bit.ly/2zlNjbe  or zip in folder
Imagine, you work at a company that wants to build a personalised music service which plays
tracks depending on a number of variables: user, weather, mood, road type, etc.
Currently, we are in a very initial stage and want to understand the data, find interactions
between variables.
Please do an exploratory analysis of the data, prepare a report with conclusions and charts.
What trends do you see? What features would you suggest to focus on?

Task 2: Recommender for Music in a Car
Prepare a model, an initial version of a recommender system, and build a simple, minimal REST
service providing predictions based on that new model (single endpoint returning a list of
recommended tracks based on an input data). Provide documentation on how to test and run
the service.

Bonus points:
● Containerize the application with docker
● Provide additional endpoint returning quality measures for currently deployed model
(can be provided from notebook used to train the model in a json format)


GOOD LUCK!
