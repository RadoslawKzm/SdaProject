The seasoned and cultured but jaded Somerset researches the Seven Deadly Sins in an effort to understand the killer\'s modus operandi while the bright but green and impulsive Detective Mills (Pitt) scoffs at his efforts to get inside the mind of a killer...', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'United States', 'Awards': 'Nominated for 1 Oscar. 29 wins & 43 nominations total', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUwODM5MTctZjczMi00OTk4LTg3NWUtNmVhMTAzNTNjYjcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '8.6/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '82%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '65/100'}], 'Metascore': '65', 'imdbRating': '8.6', 'imdbVotes': '1,520,496', 'imdbID': 'tt0114369', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '19 Dec 2000', 'BoxOffice': '$100,125,643', 'Production': 'N/A', 'Website': 'N/A', 'Response': 'True'}, {'Title': 'City of God', 'Year': '2011', 'Rated': 'N/A', 'Released': '23 Mar 2011', 'Runtime': '145 min', 'Genre': 'Drama', 'Director': 'Lijo Jose Pellissery', 'Writer': 'Babu Janardanan', 'Actors': 'Prithviraj Sukumaran, Indrajith Sukumaran, Rajeev Pillai', 'Plot': 'In the city of Cochin a series of incidents connects the lives of a Tamil laborer couple, an actress, a builder, a criminal, and the wife of a businessman,', 'Language': 'Malayalam, Tamil', 'Country': 'India', 'Awards': 'N/A', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjVlYzFhZWUtYzIxMi00NTVlLTgwZTMtOTU4MWI4MDI3NDFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjkxNzQ1NDI@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.1/10'}], 'Metascore': 'N/A', 'imdbRating': '7.1', 'imdbVotes': '612', 'imdbID': 'tt1854518', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': 'N/A', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'N/A', 'Website': 'N/A', 'Response': 'True'}, {'Title': 'Seven Pounds', 'Year': '2008', 'Rated': 'PG-13', 'Released': '19 Dec 2008', 'Runtime': '123 min', 'Genre': 'Drama', 'Director': 'Gabriele Muccino', 'Writer': 'Grant Nieporte', 'Actors': 'Will Smith, Rosario Dawson, Woody Harrelson', 'Plot': "Haunted by a secret, Ben Thomas looks for redemption by radically transforming the lives of seven people he doesn't know.

After graduation, she aspires to work in the agency\'s Behavioral Science Unit under the leadership of Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). While she is still a trainee, Crawford asks her to question Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins), a psychiatrist imprisoned, thus far, for eight years in maximum security isolation for being a serial killer who cannibalized his victims. Clarice is able to figure out the assignment is to pick Lecter\'s brains to help them solve another serial murder case, that of someone coined by the media as "Buffalo Bill" (Ted Levine), who has so far killed five victims, all located in the eastern U.S., all young women, who are slightly overweight (especially around the hips), all who were drowned in natural bodies of water, and all who were stripped of large swaths of skin. She also figures that Crawford chose her, as a woman, to be able to trigger some emotional response from Lecter. After speaking to Lecter for the first time, she realizes that everything with him will be a psychological game, with her often having to read between the very cryptic lines he provides. She has to decide how much she will play along, as his request in return for talking to him is to expose herself emotionally to him. The case takes a more dire turn when a sixth victim is discovered, this one from who they are able to retrieve a key piece of evidence, if Lecter is being forthright as to its meaning. A potential seventh victim is high profile Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker), which places greater scrutiny on the case as they search for a hopefully still alive Catherine. Who may factor into what happens is Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald), the warden at the prison, an opportunist who sees the higher profile with Catherine, meaning a higher profile for himself if he can insert himself successfully into the proceedings.', 'Language': 'English, Latin', 'Country': 'United States', 'Awards': 'Won 5 Oscars. 69 wins & 51 nominations total', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjNhZTk0ZmEtNjJhMi00YzFlLWE1MmEtYzM1M2ZmMGMwMTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '8.6/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '96%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '85/100'}], 'Metascore': '85', 'imdbRating': '8.6', 'imdbVotes': '1,337,945', 'imdbID': 'tt0102926', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '21 Aug 2001', 'BoxOffice': '$130,742,922', 'Production': 'N/A', 'Website': 'N/A', 'Response': 'True'}, {'Title': 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Year': '1998', 'Rated': 'R', 'Released': '24 Jul 1998', 'Runtime': '169 min', 'Genre': 'Drama, War', 'Director': 'Steven Spielberg', 'Writer': 'Robert Rodat', 'Actors': 'Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore', 'Plot': 'Opening with the Allied invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944, members of the 2nd Ranger Battalion under Cpt.

Andrew quickly learns that Fletcher operates on fear and intimidation, never settling for what he considers less than the best each and every time. Being the best in Fletcher's mind does not only entail playing well, but knowing that you're playing well and if not what you're doing wrong. His modus operandi creates an atmosphere of fear and of every man or woman for him/herself within the band. Regardless, Andrew works hard to be the best.

Lester's infatuation with Angela gives him a reenergized view on life, where he openly doesn't care anymore what anyone thinks about what he does, anyone except Angela.

Dick', 'Actors': 'Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young', 'Plot': 'In the early twenty-first century, the Tyrell Corporation, during what was called the Nexus phase, developed robots, called "replicants", that were supposed to aid society, the replicants which looked and acted like humans. When the superhuman generation Nexus 6 replicants, used for dangerous off-Earth endeavors, began a mutiny on an off-Earth colony, replicants became illegal on Earth. Police units, called "blade runners", have the job of destroying - or in their parlance "retiring" - any replicant that makes its way back to or created on Earth, with anyone convicted of aiding or assisting a replicant being sentenced to death. It\'s now November, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. Rick Deckard, a former blade runner, is called out of retirement when four known replicants, most combat models, have made their way back to Earth, with their leader being Roy Batty. One, Leon Kowalski, tried to infiltrate his way into the Tyrell Corporation as an employee, but has since been able to escape. Beyond following Leon\'s trail in hopes of finding and retiring them all, Deckard believes part of what will help him is figuring out what the replicants wanted with the Tyrell Corporation in trying to infiltrate it. The answer may lie with Tyrell\'s fail-safe backup mechanism. Beyond tracking the four, Deckard faces a possible dilemma in encountering a fifth replicant: Rachael, who works as Tyrell\'s assistant. The issue is that Dr. Elden Tyrell is experimenting with her, to provide her with fake memories so as to be able to better control her. With those memories, Rachael has no idea that she is not human. The problem is not only Rachael\'s assistance to Deckard, but that he is beginning to develop feelings for her.', 'Language': 'English, German, Cantonese, Japanese, Hungarian, Arabic, Korean', 'Country': 'United States', 'Awards': 'Nominated for 2 Oscars. 12 wins & 19 nominations total', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQzMzJhZTEtOWM4NS00MTdhLTg0YjgtMjM4MDRkZjUwZDBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '8.1/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '90%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '84/100'}], 'Metascore': '84', 'imdbRating': '8.1', 'imdbVotes': '724,617', 'imdbID': 'tt0083658', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '30 Oct 2001', 'BoxOffice': '$32,868,943', 'Production': 'N/A', 'Website': 'N/A', 'Response': 'True'}, {'Title': 'Jurassic Park', 'Year': '1993', 'Rated': 'PG-13', 'Released': '11 Jun 1993', 'Runtime': '127 min', 'Genre': 'Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi', 'Director': 'Steven Spielberg', 'Writer': 'Michael Crichton, David Koepp', 'Actors': 'Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum', 'Plot': 'Huge advancements in scientific technology have enabled a mogul to create an island full of living dinosaurs.
