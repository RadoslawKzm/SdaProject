# Chess task for dupa


Task:
```bash
The problem is to find all unique configurations of a set of normal chess pieces on a chess board with
dimensions M×N where none of the pieces is in a position to take any of the others. Providing the number
of results is useful, but not enough to complete the assignment. Assume the colour of the piece does not
matter, and that there are no pawns among the pieces.
